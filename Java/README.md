##  DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself
###### Why it's problematic?

> The problem arises when you need to change a representation of things that are across all the code base. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

Types of duplication:

- Imposed duplication Developers feel they have no choice—the environment seems to require duplication.
- Inadvertent duplication Developers don't realize that they are duplicating information.
- Impatient duplication Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easier.
- Interdeveloper duplication Multiple people on a team (or on different teams) duplicate a piece of information.
